# Changes

V2023.1

* New Feature to Lock Elements (not Gumplings) and disable the Ability to accidently moving them by mouse. They still can be moved by Keyboard or Properties
* HTMLElement, LabelElement, TextEntryElement no longer causes crashing on code generation when text is null
* CheckBox, HTMLElement now will generate boolean values as code in lowercase

# Compability

The Project seemed to be original build in Visual Studio. In Rider or other IDEÂ´s might be some issues on compiling.
